 ChaosVis is a Visualiser Tool for visualising attractor systems and other chaotic data
 
 Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics focusing on the study of chaos â€” dynamical systems whose apparently random states of disorder and irregularities are actually governed by underlying patterns and deterministic laws that are highly sensitive to initial conditions.

 Small differences in initial conditions lead to vastly different lifepaths in these systems

 Chaos theory led to other popular concepts like The Butterfly Effect
